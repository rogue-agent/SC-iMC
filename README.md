# A Simple Computer - in Minecraft

Because I didn't sleep and didn't feel like being tired I tried something new.

Building a computer that should store, fetch, decode, and execute values added into the memory. At a later time point I hope I can make it run the Risc-V instructions...

This is made for educational purposes.

# Requirements:
Maybe: Minecraft version 1.19.2


# Current version
